# Temperature_Monitoring_system
Home Automation System Which can control temperature according to the environment 
The Temperature Monitoring System is a project designed to monitor and manage temperature levels in various environments. This system is built to ensure the optimal temperature conditions are maintained and provide alerts in case of temperature deviations. It can be used in various applications such as server rooms, greenhouses, warehouses, and more.

**Features**
- Real-time Monitoring: Continuously monitors temperature levels and provides real-time updates on a user-friendly dashboard.

- Threshold Alerts: Set temperature thresholds for high and low levels. Receive instant alerts via email or SMS when thresholds are exceeded.

- Data Logging: Log and store historical temperature data for analysis and record-keeping.

- Graphical Representation: Visualize temperature trends over time through interactive graphs and charts.

- Multi-sensor Support: Connect and monitor multiple temperature sensors simultaneously.


**System Architecture**
The Temperature Monitoring System consists of the following components:

- Temperature Sensors: These sensors are deployed in the environment to measure temperature levels. They transmit data to the central system.

- Central Server: Receives and processes temperature data from sensors. Manages user authentication, data storage, and communication with the user interface.

- Database: Stores historical temperature data for analysis and reporting.

- Alerting System: Monitors temperature thresholds and sends out alerts (email/SMS) when thresholds are crossed.
